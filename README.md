I aimed to improve the accessibility of the webpage of a fictional business. Creating accessibile and well-structured webpages is crucial when operating an online presence and for the effectiveness of a website. The changes I made also allows the site to have improved online visibility, as search engines penalize inaccessible sites.

Through this project, I learned the hallmarks of accessible design and how to improve the user experience.
